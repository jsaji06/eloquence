To better understand the context behind the essay, here is a brief, one sentence summary of the subsection preceding this one: {summary}

NOTE: If there was NO context provided, this implies that this is the introductory paragraph to the essay, so please treat this as such.

Analyze this subsection and create exactly 3 critical points with consideration of the context of the previous subsection, if included.

Subsection to analyze:

</writing_content>

Generate exactly 3 critical points that challenge, question, or explore this content.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with a JSON object matching this exact structure:
