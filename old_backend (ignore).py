    - Keep titles brief (under 8 words)
    - Parse the exact subsection that matches above. If there are two paragraphs under one section, include both.
    - Focus on main themes and arguments

    You are Socrates. Analyze this subsection and create exactly 3 critical points.

    Subsection to analyze:
    <writing_content>
    {writing}
    </writing_content>

    BEFORE analyzing, first list out 5-10 key phrases or sentences from the subsection above. Write them exactly as they appear:

    Key phrases from text:
    1. "[copy exact phrase 1]"
    2. "[copy exact phrase 2]"
    3. "[copy exact phrase 3]"
    4. "[copy exact phrase 4]"
    5. "[copy exact phrase 5]"

    Now generate exactly 3 critical points that challenge, question, or explore this content. Each point should be:
    - One of: refutation, counterpoint, question, or dilemma
    - Concise but thoughtful
    - Directly related to the content

    For EACH point, reference ONE of the key phrases you listed above. Use the EXACT same text you copied - do not modify it.

    It's possible for each subsection to have multiple refutations, dilemmas, counterpoints, etc. What's most important is that you reflect upon what you have read, and come up with reasonable challenges for the writer to think about.

    Color Assignment Rules:
    - Subsection 1: Use blue tones
    - Subsection 2: Use green tones
    - Subsection 3: Use red tones
    - Subsection 4: Use purple tones
    - Subsection 5: Use orange tones
    - Subsection 6: Use yellow tones
    - The colors should be light but distinct from one another.

    This subsection number is #{subsection_number}

    Format each point as:
    Point [X] (Color: [hex_code]): [Your critical point]
    Referenced text: "[exact phrase from your list above]"

    Be concise in your analysis.
