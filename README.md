## üß† Philosophy

Writing is one of the most effective communicators of ideas. However, with unpolished, unclear writing, some of the ideas the writer wants to communicate may be overlooked. Sometimes, peer reviewers may not be able to truly break an argument down. That's why Eloquence was built - Eloquence is not just your average peer reviewer. It's a thinking assistant. It's ultimate goal: make you a better thinker, not just a cleaner writer.
